  abstract = {Anisotropy invariant map proposed by Lumley and Newman and barycentric map proposed by Banerjee et al. were used in order to estimate the degree of anisotropy in turbulent swirl flow. The differences in visual interpretations of anisotropy states in these two maps were analysed and mathematical basis of these two maps was derived. Experimental data reveal that there is significant influence of swirl on the anisotropy of turbulence. Anisotropy invariant mapping shows that different flow regions of swirl flow are characterized by different anisotropy states.},

  title = {Anisotropy {{Properties}} of {{Turbulence}}},
  abstract = {In the literature, anisotropy-invariant maps are being proposed to represent a domain within which all realizable Reynolds stress invariants must lie. It is shown that the representation proposed by Lumley and Newman has disadvantages owing to the fact that the anisotropy invariants (II, III) are nonlinear functions of stresses. In the current work, it is proposed to use an equivalent linear representation of the anisotropy invariants in terms of eigenvalues. A novel barycentric map, based on the convex combination of scalar metrics dependent on eigenvalues, is proposed to provide a non-distorted visual representation of anisotropy in turbulent quantities. This barycentric map provides the possibility of viewing the Reynolds stress and any anisotropic stress tensor. Additionally the barycentric map provides the possibility of quantifying the weighting for any point inside it in terms of the limiting states (one component, two component, three component). The mathematical basis for the barycentric map is derived using the spectral decomposition theorem for second-order tensors. In this way, an analytical proof is provided that All turbulence lies along the boundaries or inside the barycentric map. It is proved that the barycentric map and the anisotropy-invariant maps are one to one uniquely interdependent and as a result satisfy the requirement of realizability.},
